# Project 1: Minimal cybersecurity preprocessing

## Project structure

* `data` folder: contains constants about datasets.
* `Models` folder: contains trainings' results.
* `preprocessing` folder: contains scripts and functions used for preprocessing operations.
* `misc` folder: contains miscellanous scripts and outputs that helped while developing the project, but they aren't used for the project's purpose.
* current working directory: contains the 8 python script files responsible for the trainings and the collection of the metrics.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.11
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Change datasets' paths inside the scripts
4. Run script `python <training_script_name.py>`
